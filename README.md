Commit Forge is a project created solely to bypass GitHub's limitation of pinning only six repositories.

Technologies Used

In this project, I utilized the following technologies:

React – for building the user interface efficiently.

TypeScript – to ensure type safety and improve code maintainability.

UUID v4 – for generating unique identifiers.

Material UI – for creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

The main goal of Commit Forge is to provide a flexible way to showcase repositories without the constraints imposed by GitHub. By leveraging modern web technologies, it delivers a smooth and interactive user experience for developers who want more control over their repository display options.
